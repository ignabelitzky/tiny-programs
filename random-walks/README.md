# Random Walk

This C++ program creates a graphical simulation of multiple random walkers using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The walkers move randomly within the window, changing their color with each step.

## Features

- **Random Walkers**: Each walker moves in a random direction at each step.
- **Color Change**: Walkers change color randomly as they move.
- **Memory Management**: Proper handling of memory for each dynamically allocated walkers.

## Requirements

To build and run this program, you need the following:

- **C++ Compiler**: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++` or `clang`)
- **SFML Library**: This project depends on SFML for graphics rendering.

## How to Build

To compile the program, just use the Makefile

```bash
make
```

This command will create an executable named main.

## How to Run

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
./main
```

This will open a window displaying the random walkers as they move around.
